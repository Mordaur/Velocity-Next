Velocity-Next
=============

**Velocity-Next is a continuation of the original [Velocity](https://github.com/hetelek/Velocity) project, which ceased active development some time ago. This fork aims to modernize the codebase, add new features, and maintain compatibility with current operating systems and toolchains.**

### What's New in Velocity-Next

- **Smart Pointer Refactoring**: Modern C++20 memory management for improved stability
- **ISO/XEX Integration**: Merged improvements from Gualdimar/Velocity fork
- **MSVC 2022 Support**: Full compatibility with Visual Studio 2022 alongside MinGW
- **Modernized Build System**: CMake 3.20+ with modern target-based patterns
- **Standalone XboxInternals Library**: Can now be distributed and used independently
- **Active Development**: Issues and PRs are welcomed and will be addressed

### Credits

Original Velocity was developed mainly by Stevie Hetelekides (Hetelek) and Adam Spindler (Experiment5X), with contributions from [many others](https://github.com/hetelek/Velocity/graphs/contributors). Velocity-Next continues their work with gratitude and respect for the foundation they built.

## Raw Device Access

On **Windows**, Velocity starts without elevation. Browsing uses read-only raw access where Windows permits it; writing to a device (copy/delete/resign) requires running as administrator.

## Running Velocity-Next

- If Xbox 360 drives are not detected, **right-click** `VelocityNext.exe` → **"Run as administrator"**
- Or create an administrator shortcut: executable → **Create shortcut** → shortcut **Properties** → **Advanced** → **Run as administrator**
- On **Linux**, run with `sudo` or add your user to the `disk` group
- On **macOS**, run with `sudo` for now

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md#running-velocity) for Linux/macOS requirements and more details.
